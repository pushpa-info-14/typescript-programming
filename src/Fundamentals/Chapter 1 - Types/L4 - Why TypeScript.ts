/**

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning that:

  -All JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code.
  -All TypeScript code is not necessarily valid JavaScript code.

But who tf cares? The real question is, why should I use TypeScript instead of JavaScript? Well, TypeScript is fantastic because it:

  -Catches a ton of bugs and errors at compile time (fact)
  -Makes your code more readable and maintainable (imo)
  -Makes it easier to refactor and scale your codebase (imo)

In short, it adds static typing to JavaScript.
