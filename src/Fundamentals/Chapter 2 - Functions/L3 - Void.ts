/**
In JavaScript, a function without a return statement returns undefined by default... but that's kinda vague. 
TypeScript uses the void keyword to indicate that truly nothing is returned.

In other words, void more explicitly communicates the intent that a function returns nothing.

function logMessage(message: string): void {
  console.log(message);
  // nothing is returned here!
}
