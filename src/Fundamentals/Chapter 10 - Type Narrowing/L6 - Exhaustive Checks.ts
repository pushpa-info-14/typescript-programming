/**
 * Exhaustive Checks
 *
 * If you've ever heard a Rust enjoyer (and let's be honest, if you know one, you've heard from them) talk
 * about how great the Rust programming language is, you've probably heard them mention "pattern matching" and "exhaustive checks".
 *
 * To be fair, it's a pretty cool idea. Say we have this union type:
 */

type Notify = "email" | "sms" | "push";

/**
 * and we have this function that uses it:
 */

function sendNotification(notify: Notify) {
  switch (notify) {
    case "email":
      return "Sending email";
    case "sms":
      return "Sending SMS";
    case "push":
      return "Sending push notification";
  }
  return "Unknown notification type";
}

/**
 * This might be a very reasonable way to write JavaScript code, but that final return "Unknown notification type";
 * is actually redundant in good TypeScript code. The switch statement is exhaustive, and TypeScript is smart
 * enough to know that return "Unknown notification type"; is actually unreachable code, and will give us a
 * compiler error (assuming we have configured tsc to do so)!
 *
 * Design your types so that you get these kinds of useful errors.
