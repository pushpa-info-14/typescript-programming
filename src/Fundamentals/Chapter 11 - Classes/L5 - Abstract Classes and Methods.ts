/**
 * Abstract Classes and Methods
 *
 * An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly.
 * It's a template for inheritance, forcing subclasses to implement specific methods or properties.
 * Say we have this Shape class
 */

// Error: Cannot create an instance of an abstract class
// const shape = new Shape("small");

/**
 * Within an abstract class, abstract methods (like calculateArea above) do not have an implementation because the implementation must be provided by the subclass.
 * However, it can still have regular methods (like displayArea above) which are then shared by all subclasses.
 *
 * So, we can create a Circle class that extends Shape and implements the calculateArea method:
 */

      this.radius = 15;
    }
  }

  calculateArea(): number {
    return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
  }
}

// And of course, the Circle class can be instantiated:

const circle = new Circle("medium");
circle.displayArea();
// The area of this shape is 314.1592653589793
