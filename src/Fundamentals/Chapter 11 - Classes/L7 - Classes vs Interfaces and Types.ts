/**
 * Classes vs. Interfaces and Types
 *
 * You might be wondering when you should use a full-blown class to create reusable object types over interfaces and type aliases.
 * There are 3 ways to model the same thing!

class Hero {
  name: string = "";
  health: number = 1;

interface Hero2 {
  name: string;
  health: number;

/**
 * If you're an object-oriented programmer, you might be more comfortable with classes and the extra features they provide.
 * Classes can basically do everything that interfaces can do, and more. Some of the most notable things you can't do with
 * interfaces and type aliases are:
 *  - Have private, protected, static, and abstract members
 *  - Have dedicated constructors
 *  - Have method implementations predefined on all instances
 *
 * And on the other hand:
 *  - Type aliases and interfaces have no runtime overhead
 *  - Type aliases and interfaces have fewer features, and as a result, are simpler to work with when you don't need the extra features
 *  - Type aliases and interfaces are more flexible, especially when working with plain objects because they're not tied to the class implementation (signature only)
 *  - Interfaces can be extended and merged in ways that types and classes can't

/**
 * Personally, I'm a simple man. I tend to use type aliases when I can, and only reach for the additional features of classes
 * when I feel I need them, which is rare in web development, at least in my opinion.
