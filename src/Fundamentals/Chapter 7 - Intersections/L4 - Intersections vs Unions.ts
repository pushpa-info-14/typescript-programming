/**
Unions
-Use the | operator (suspiciously similar to the logical OR operator)
-Widen the resulting type (more possible values)
-Useful for modeling mutually exclusive options or states

Intersections
-Use the & operator (like logical AND)
-Narrow the resulting type (fewer possible values)
-Useful for combining multiple constraints or adding more required properties to existing types
