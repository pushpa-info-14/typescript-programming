/**
 * Partial Utility Type
 *
 * There are several built-in utility types that transform existing types into new ones.
 * One of the most useful is Partial<T>, which makes all properties of a type optional. For example:
 */

type User = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

// Without Partial
function updateUser(
  userId: string,
  userInfo: {
    id?: string;
    name?: string;
    email?: string;
  },
) {
  // ...
}

// With Partial
function updateUser2(userId: string, userInfo: Partial<User>) {
  // ...
}

/**
 * Instead of copy/pasting the type definition, the Partial<T> utility type allows us to generate a new type based on an existing one.
 * That also means if the original is ever updated, the new type created with Partial<T> type will automatically have those changes!
 *
 * Nested Objects
 *
 * Partial<T> only makes the top-level properties optional. For example:
 */

type User2 = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  preferences: {
    theme: string;
    notifications: boolean;
  };
};

/**
 * If we use Partial<User>, the resulting type would look like this:
 */

// same as 'type LooseyGooseyUser = Partial<User>'
type LooseyGooseyUser = {
  id?: string;
  name?: string;
  preferences?: {
    theme: string;
    notifications: boolean;
  };
};

/**
 * The theme and notifications properties are still required (assuming preferences is provided).
 */
