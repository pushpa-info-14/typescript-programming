/**
 * Pros of Unions
 * - Unions are what you use for complex types, so it feels consistent to use them for primitives as well
 * - Unions don't add any additional runtime code
 * - It's less verbose to write a union
 *
 * Pros of Enums
 * -  Enums are slightly easier to refactor because if you change the value of a label (e.g. "Hearts" to "hearts"),
 *    you don't have to change the string literal in every place you use it.
 * -  If you're using numerical enums, then the reverse mapping can be useful I guess.
 * -  CardSuit.Hearts provides more context than just "Hearts". That said, any good editor is going
 *    to say type CardSuit on hover, so it's not a huge win.

/**
 * Personally, I use unions over enums pretty much every time. In fact, Anders Hejlsberg (the creator of TypeScript)
 * has said that they might not even add enums to TypeScript if they were starting over.
