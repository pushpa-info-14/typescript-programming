/**
 * Multiple Type Parameters
 *
 * There's no need to be limited to just a single type parameter in TypeScript! They're just parameters, and
 * you can have as many as you need (but please don't go crazy).
 *
 * To prove that T is just a random name, I'm going to use longer names in this lesson... but just
 * be aware that short capital letters like T, U, V, etc. are the most common convention for generic type parameters.
 *
 * Let's create a function that "transforms" its inputs. It takes as input:
 *
 *  - An array of items of type InputType
 *  - A function that takes an item of type InputType and returns an item of type OutputType
 *
 * And it returns a new array of items of type OutputType.
 */

function transform<InputType, OutputType>(
  inputs: InputType[],
  update: (item: InputType) => OutputType,
): OutputType[] {
  const outputs: OutputType[] = [];
  for (const input of inputs) {
    const output = update(input);
    outputs.push(output);
  }
  return outputs;
}

/**
 * If you've been paying close attention, we basically just built our own version of Array.prototype.map.
 *
 * Now we can use our own custom transformers with our custom transform function!
 */

type Human = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

const humans: Human[] = [
  { name: "Eren", age: 15 },
  { name: "Mikasa", age: 16 },
  { name: "Armin", age: 15 },
];

const titanTransformer = (human: Human): string => `${human.name} is a titan!`;

const titanNames = transform<Human, string>(humans, titanTransformer);
console.log(titanNames);
// ['Eren is a titan!', 'Mikasa is a titan!', 'Armin is a titan!']

/**
 * Without changing our transform function, we can use it to transform entirely different types of data:
 */

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const double = (num: number): number => num * 2;

const doubledNumbers = transform<number, number>(numbers, double);
console.log(doubledNumbers);
// [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
