// So we know we can drastically narrow a primitive type like "number" by using a union of literal types.
// For example, maybe only 3 error codes are valid:

type ErrorSlugs = "OK" | "NOT_FOUND" | "INTERNAL_ERROR";

// This works great if these are the only valid error codes, but what if:
//  1. Any string can be used as an error slug
//  2. "OK", "NOT_FOUND", and "INTERNAL_ERROR" are the most common values and we like to have them show up in autocomplete
// TypeScript has a hacky way for us to express this: super set unions.

type ErrorCodes = "OK" | "NOT_FOUND" | "INTERNAL_ERROR" | (string & {});

/**
 You might be wondering,

 "Why wouldn't I just use string - the set of allowed values is the same?"

 And you're right, but there's one subtle difference. By adding (string & {}), TypeScript won't change which values are allowed. 
 Any string is allowed. But it will still give us autocomplete in our editor for the values "OK", "NOT_FOUND", and "INTERNAL_ERROR".
