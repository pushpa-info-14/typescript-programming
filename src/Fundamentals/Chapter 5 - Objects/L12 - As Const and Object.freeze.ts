// The as const assertion creates a readonly type using literal values:

const colorsConst = ["red", "green", "blue"] as const;

// Error: Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly ["red", "green", "blue"]'
// colorsConst.push("yellow");

// It works great with objects too, and unlike most utility types and Object.freeze(),
// it automatically makes all nested structures readonly as well:

const configConst = {
  apiUrl: "https://api.cobrakai.com",
  admins: {
    johnny: "lawrence",
    daniel: "larusso",
  },
  features: ["no mercy", "not crying", "winning too much"],
} as const;

// Error: Cannot assign to 'apiUrl' because it is a read-only property
// configConst.apiUrl = "https://api.karate.com";

// Error: Cannot assign to 'johnny' because it is a read-only property
// configConst.admins.johnny = "larusso";

// Error: Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly ["no mercy", "not crying", "winning too much"]'
// configConst.features.push("sweep the leg");

/**
 The Object.freeze() method is a built-in JavaScript function that prevents modifications to the top level 
 of an object at runtime. It makes the object immutable, but it does not affect TypeScript's type system.

const frozenConfig = Object.freeze({
  apiUrl: "https://api.cobrakai.com",
  admins: {
    johnny: "lawrence",
    daniel: "larusso",
  },
  features: ["no mercy", "not crying", "winning too much"],
});

// Error: Cannot assign to 'apiUrl' because it is a read-only property
// frozenConfig.apiUrl = "https://api.karate.com";

// This is fine because nested properties are not frozen automatically
frozenConfig.admins.johnny = "kreese";

// This is also fine because the array is not frozen
frozenConfig.features.push("sweep the leg");

/**
 TypeScript is smart enough to recognize that Object.freeze is being called, so it gives us a nice compile-time 
 error when we try to modify the top-level properties. And because Object.freeze() is a runtime operation, 
 it will still fail at runtime if a mutation actually happens. It's worth mentioning that in non-strict mode JS, 
 mutations of a frozen object are silently ignored, but in strict mode, they throw a TypeError.
