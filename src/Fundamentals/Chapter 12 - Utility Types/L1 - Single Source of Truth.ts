/**
 * Single Source of Truth
 *
 * It's incredibly common for a TypeScript codebase to amass a truly absurd number of custom type
 * definitions - hundreds of interfaces and types, all with slightly different numbers of fields for a lot of the same "entities".
 * You might run into crazy stuff like:
 */

interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
}

interface UserWithoutId {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
}

/**
 * This is bad. We generally try to avoid redefining the same types over and over, and instead try to follow
 * a "single source of truth" approach. For example, here we could refactor a bit:
 */

interface UserWithoutId {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
}

interface User extends UserWithoutId {
  id: string;
}

/**
 * There are other techniques to do this even more cleanly that we'll cover later in this chapter.
 *
 * In other words, we try to define our types once, and build type systems that rely on inference and type
 * transformations to derive the types we need automatically. That way, when we make changes, we only have
 * to do it in one place. In our second example, updating UserWithoutId will now automatically update User as well: a big win.
