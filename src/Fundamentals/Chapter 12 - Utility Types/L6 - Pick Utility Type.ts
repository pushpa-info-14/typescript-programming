/**
 * Pick Utility Type
 *
 * The Pick<T, K> utility type creates a new type by selecting a subset of properties from an existing type. For example:
 */

interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  inStock: boolean;
  images: string[];
  reviews: { user: string; rating: number; text: string }[];
}

type ProductSummary = Pick<Product, "id" | "name" | "price">;

const productList: ProductSummary[] = [
  { id: "p1", name: "Keyboard", price: 79.99 },
  { id: "p2", name: "Mouse", price: 59.99 },
];

const invalidProduct: ProductSummary = {
  id: "p3",
  name: "Headphones",
  price: 99.99,
  // TSC error:
  // Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'description' does not exist in type 'ProductSummary'.
  // description: "Noise cancelling headphones",
};

/**
 * Pick is very useful for creating quick types for functions that don't need everything from the original type.
