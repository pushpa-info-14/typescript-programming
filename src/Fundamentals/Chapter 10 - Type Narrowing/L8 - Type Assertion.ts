/**
 * Type Assertion
 *
 * Sometimes you know more about a value's type than TypeScript does... it's rare but it happens. The as keyword is the "trust me, bro" of TypeScript.
 *
 * In the Boot.dev codebase, we have some places where we know a query parameter is a string, but Vue (our front-end framework) uses string | string[]
 * for query params... which makes sense because query params can be arrays, but we know in many cases (because our back-end controls this) that it's always a string.
 *
 * So, we have something like this:
 */

type Route = {
  query: { userId: string | string[] };
};
const route: Route = {
  query: { userId: "" },
};
// Property 'toLowerCase' does not exist on type 'string | string[]'
// const userId = route.query?.userId.toLowerCase();

/**
 * But we know it's never an array, so we just use as string to do this:
 */

const userId = (route.query?.userId as string).toLowerCase();

/**
 * We also capture values that come across the network as unknown and then use as to assert them into the shape we expect a given network response to be:
 */

type User = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
};

async function getUserRaw(userId: string): Promise<unknown> {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
  return response.json();
}

export async function getUser(userId: string) {
  const data = await getUserRaw(userId);
  // here data is still just "unknown"
  // so we assert it to a User type
  return data as User;
}

/**
 * Angle Bracket Syntax
 *
 * There is an alternative syntax for type assertions using angle brackets and the type before the value:
 */

const userIdRaw = <string>route.query?.userId;
const userId2 = userIdRaw.toLowerCase();

/**
 * When to Do Type Assertions
 *
 * - I try to avoid them. I'd rather use actual conditional narrowing over assertions unless I'm extremely confident.
 *    Conditional narrowing is safer because it doesn't involve assumptions.
 * - I prefer the as syntax over the angle bracket syntax. It's clearer, easier to read, and easier to write.
