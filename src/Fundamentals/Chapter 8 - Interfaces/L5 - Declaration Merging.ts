/**
 * Okay, so here's the quirk that makes me recommend type over interface in most cases.
 * Declaration merging is, in my experience, mostly a footgun.
 * Sure, it's useful in certain niche cases (like modifying the global Window type in front-end code),
 * but most of the time it leads to confusing bugs.
 *
 * When you declare the same interface (use the same name) multiple times, all the declarations are merged. This:
