/**
 * Unknown Type
 *
 * We've talked about the any type in TypeScript, and how it can represent anything - it's the "widest" type.
 *
 * The unknown type can be used for similar purposes, but it's a much safer alternative because it forces you
 * to explicitly assert the type before using it in a specific way.
 */

/**
 * The “any” Problem
 *
 * The any type basically turns off TypeScript's type checking:
 */

function processData(data: any) {
  // TypeScript allows this even though it might crash
  console.log(data.toLowerCase());

  // TypeScript allows this too - it's like we're using plain JavaScript
  return data.nonExistentMethod();
}

// No errors when calling the function
processData(42); // Will crash at runtime

/**
 * As we talked about earlier, when you take plain JavaScript code and run it through TypeScript tooling, almost everything is any by default.
 */

/**
 * The “unknown” Solution
 *
 * The unknown type doesn't allow that kind of tomfoolery:
 */

function processData2(data: unknown) {
  // Error: Object is of type 'unknown'
  // console.log(data.toLowerCase());
  // Error: Object is of type 'unknown'
  // return data.nonExistentMethod();
}

/**
 * With unknown, you can still assign any value to it (e.g. call this function with any value),
 * but you can't use that value in a meaningful way without first checking its type:
 */

function processData3(data: unknown) {
  // We do a type assertion
  if (typeof data === "string") {
    // Now TypeScript knows data is a string
    console.log(data.toLowerCase());
    return data;
  }
  if (typeof data === "number") {
    // Now TypeScript knows data is a number
    return data * 2;
  }

  // Throw an error for other types
  // that we can't handle
  throw new Error("Expected string data");
}

/**
 * When to Use unknown
 *
 * Unknown is a fantastic alternative to any when it comes to dealing with values that are
 * coming into your program from the outside world (e.g. user input, API responses, etc.).
 * It forces you to add type checks at that I/O boundary so that you can then be confident working with the data inside your program.
