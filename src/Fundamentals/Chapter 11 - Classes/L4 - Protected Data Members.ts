/**
 * Protected Data Members
 *
 * The protected keyword is unique to TypeScript in that it's not part of the EcmaScript standard.
 * It allows you to define members that are accessible within the class and its subclasses, but not from outside the class.
 * It's like "private but also accessible to subclasses".
